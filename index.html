      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is used to make creating and running applications easier by using containers.  The container packages up all of the required parts ensuring the application will run on other machines despite having different settings.  Docker is similar to a VM but does not include a virtual operating system, instead the application relies on the host system but is shipped with libraries and dependencies which may not be running on the host computer.  This method of packaging offers better performance than a VM.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is a web server known for high performance and stability.  Originally NGINX supported HTML but it has expanded to support more complex content.  Given the level of performance NGINX has achieved it is also used as a reverse proxy and load balancer for slower systems such as databases and microservices.
