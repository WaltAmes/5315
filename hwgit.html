      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an open source version control system, developed in 2005 by the creator of the Linux OS, it is the most common version control system used today.  Version control is important because it records any changes made to files and allows users to recall previous versions of those files, compare changes to previous versions, see which user made changes, reduce duplication, reduce errors, as well as recover files.  All of these factors are important for work with multiple contributors and frequent revisions because version control enables the management of changes made to any files or information.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>Local repository (repo) is a directory on the computer a user works on or makes changes in, it contains all the files and their commit history.  A remote repo is a repository located on a server which multiple users can access and commit files.  Unlike a local repo a remote repo is not located on your computer but a space shared by users.  Multiple users can work on the same project at the same time using new branches created from a master branch.  Users will then checkout features to make and commit changes, this can happen simultaneously on the same project.  Once a user is finished making changes they will fetch from the remote repo and rebase all changes made into one commit.  Following this step the master branch will be checked out and pulled, the user will then merge their feature and push to git.  Once the changed have been pushed the merged feature branch can be deleted.
